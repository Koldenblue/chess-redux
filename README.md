# react-chess

This app is partially based on a translation from Python code (also written by me), which can be found at <a href=https://github.com/Koldenblue/python-chess-game>this GitHub repository</a>.

Work in progress. Game logic is partially written. This app uses React components to present the front end. A Redux store is used to provide a global state to components.
